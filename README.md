## NEW ! from v1.1.9 : Wall of Flipper !!! 
### You can run it but you can't hide !!!! 

Based on an original idea from K3YOMI, thanks to him for the fantastic work ! 

You absolutely must see the original project here from which I took inspiration and from which I used the code :

https://github.com/K3YOMI/Wall-of-Flippers

Flipper Zero detection via bluetooth :

Discover Flipper Zero Devices :
- Discovering Flipper Name
- Discovering Flipper Mac Address and if it's spoofed (normal/spoofed)
- Discovering Flipper color (Detection of Transparent, White, & Black Flipper)
- Saving Flipper Zero Devices Discovered near you on SD Card. 

Capability to Identify Potential Bluetooth Advertisement Attacks from Flipper and Other Devices :
- Suspected Advertisement Attacks
- iOS Popup Advertisement Attacks
- Samsung and Android BLE Advertisement Attacks
- Windows Swift Pair Advertisement Attacks
- LoveSpouse Advertisement Attacks (Denial of Pleasure)

### NEW ! from v1.1.8 : Deauth Detection !

Detect deauthentication packets near you, when a machine disconnects from an access point, it sends a deauthentication packet to close the connection, 
deauthentication packets can also be spoofed to disconnect the device and attacker use automatic reconnection to sniff the 4-way handshake, 
many deauthentication packets are not normal and should be considered as a possible Wi-Fi attack. 
This feature also detects nearby pwnagotchi by printing the name and number of pwned network that it get, 
in this way you can know if you are under attacked.

## Features Evil-M5core2

- **WiFi Network Scanning**: Identify and display nearby WiFi networks.
- **Network Cloning**: Check information and replicate networks for in-depth analysis.
- **Captive Portal Management**: Create and operate a captive portal to prompt users with a page upon connection.
- **Credential Handling**: Capture and manage portal credentials.
- **Remote Web Server**: Monitor the device remotely via a simple web interface that can provide credentials and upload portal that store file on SD card.
- **Sniffing probes**: Sniff and store on SD near probes.
- **Karma Attack**: Try a simple Karma Attack on a captured probe. 
- **Automated Karma Attack**: Try Karma Attack on near probe automatically.
- **Bluetooth Serial Control**: You can control it with bluetooth.
- **Wardriving**: Wardriving with Wigle format output on SD.
- **Beacon Spam**: Generate mutliple SSIDs arround you.
- **Deauther detection**: Detect deauthentification packet and pwnagotchi near you.
- **Wall Of Flipper**: Detect and save Flipper Zero with bluetooth enable near you and detect BLE SPAM.

#### Clone & Details

- **List Details**: Informations about the selected network. You can clone the SSID in this menu.

#### Start Captive Portal

- **Operate Captive Portal**: With `normal.html` page, a mock WiFi passord page designed to mimic a legitimate error on box.

#### Special Pages
- **/evil-m5core2-menu**: Menu for pages bellow.
- **/credentials**: Lists captured credentials.
- **/uploadhtmlfile**: Provides an upload form to store files on the SD card (for new portal pages and file exfiltration).
- **/check-sd-file**: Provides an index of to check, download and delete files on the SD card.
- **/Change-Portal-Password**: Provides a page to change the password of the deployed access point.


When Captive Portal is ON you can connect to it to acces to 3 fonctionnality protected by password :

- /evil-m5core2-menu
This page is just a menu to provide easy access to others page with authentification form.

- /credentials
This page can list the captured credentials. 

- /uploadhtmlfile
This page provide a upload form that store files in SD card in any folder of the SD to be able to send new portal page, exfiltrate file trough wifi or change the startup image.
please considere to upload file under 1Mo to ensure no lag during the transfert process.

- /check-sd-file
This page provide an index of to check, download and delete files on the SD card.


- /Change-Portal-Password
Provides a page to change the password of the deployed Access Point. Required if attempting a Karma attack on a network with a known password.

  
To prevent unauthorised access of these page they are really simply protected by a password that you need to change in the code. 
To acces to these page use the password form in menu: 

http://192.168.4.1/evil-m5core2-menu

Any other tried page should redirect to the choosen portal. 

#### Stop Captive Portal

- **Deactivate**: Stops the captive portal and DNS.

#### Change Portal

- **Menu**: Choose the portal provided to connecting users. Lists only HTML files.

#### Check Credentials

- **Menu**: To check captured credentials.

#### Delete Credentials

- **Option**: Delete all captured credentials.

### Monitor Status

The Monitor Status feature consists of three static menus that can be navigated using the left and right buttons. Each menu provides specific information about the current status of the system:

#### Menu 1: System Overview
- **Number of Connected Clients**: Displays how many clients are currently connected.
- **Credentials Count**: Shows the number of passwords stored in `credentials.txt`.
- **Current Selected Portal**: Indicates which portal is currently being cloned.
- **Portal Status**: Displays whether the portal is ON or OFF.
- **Provided Portal Page**: Details about the portal page currently in use.
- **Bluetooth**: Displays whether the bluetooth is ON or OFF.

#### Menu 2: Client Information
- **MAC Addresses**: Lists the MAC addresses of all connected clients.

#### Menu 3: Device Status
- **Stack left**: Displays the remaining Stack in the device.
- **Available RAM**: Displays the remaining RAM in the device.
- **Battery Level**: Shows the current battery level.
- **Temperature**: Reports the device's internal temperature.

### Probe Attack 

Send fake random probes near you on all channel. Perfect for counter the Probe Sniffing attack. Press left or right to reduce or increase time delay. (200 ms to 1000ms)

### Probe Sniffing

Probe Sniffing start a probe scan that capture the SSID receive, you can store and reuse then. Restricted to 150 probes max.

### Karma Attack

Same as Probe Sniffing but provide a menu after stopping scan to choose a unique SSID, when SSID is chosen, a portal with the same SSID is deploy, if the original AP is an Open Network and the machine is vulnerable it should connect automaticaly to the network and dependind of the machine can pop up automatically the portal, if a client is present when scan end or stopped, the portal stay open, if not the portal is shutdown. 
(Can be used with password if set on web interface).

### Karma Auto 

Same as Karma Attack but try the first probe seen, if no client connects after 15 seconds the Evil-m5core2 returns to sniffing mode to try another captured probe and continues in a cycle until stopped by the user.
Can also be used with a password if set on the web interface, if you have a password and you don't know on which AP it work you could try it with different probe request to test if karma work and get the SSID.
This feature is inspired by the pwnagotchi project but with probe request and karma attack, you can use both to ensure a full attack of the near devices around you.

You can add SSID on KarmaAutoWhitelist line like this : KarmaAutoWhitelist=notmybox,thisonetoo 

Probe should be ignored and serial message send to notify that this network is whitelisted, it also work on probe sniffing and karma attack.

### Karma Spear 

Same as Karma Auto but with Open SSID captured with wardriving. You can also add custom SSIDs to KarmaList.txt.

### Select Probe

Menu to select a previous captured probe SSID and deploy it. List is restricted to 150 probes.

### Delete Probe

Menu to delete a previous captured probe SSID and deploy it. List is restricted to 150 probes.

### Delete All Probes

Delete ALL previous captured probes. Basically reset probes.txt on SD.

### Brightness

Change the Brightness of the screen. 

### Bluetooth ON/OFF

Switch bluetooth ON or OFF.

### Wardriving

Scan wifi network around and link it to position in Wigle format, you can upload it to wigle to earn point and generate KLM file for Google earth.
You need a GPS for this. 

Tested device working on Core2/Fire/AtomS3 :
- ATOMIC GPS Base [link M5Stack](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atomic-gps-base-m8030-kt?ref=7h30th3r0n3) [link AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DnqzH61)

GPIO 17

### Beacon Spam

Beacon Spam create multiple networks on all channels to render multiples SSIDs in wifi search and sniffing equipement.
You can use custom Beacon with config file. 

### Deauth Detection

Detect deauthentication packets near you, when a machine disconnects from an access point, it sends a deauthentication packet to close the connection, 
deauthentication packets can also be spoofed to disconnect the device and attacker use automatic reconnection to sniff the 4-way handshake, 
many deauthentication packets are not normal and should be considered as a possible Wi-Fi attack. 
This feature also detects nearby pwnagotchi by printing the name and number of pwned network that it get, 
in this way you can know if you are under attacked.

### Change startup image 
Upload a startup.jpg 320x240 image to replace original startup.jpg and make your Evil-M5Core2 more special.

## Flipper Zero Friend ?

He can also be used standalone but he needs a host for energy like a phone or a powersupply to survive or he die. 
</div>
</div>
</div>

Parasite Functionnality : 

- **Cute** (yes it's a useful feature to survive).
- **Accelerometer interaction** (don't shake it or it get mad).
- **AutoKarmaAttack** when face is pressed ( when a karma attack is successfull your little parasiste tell the name of the SSID in a textbubble until the next karma successfull or death).
- **Whitelist** (hardcoded, need to be change by compiling the code again)

(For the moment no portal is sent it just tests if a device connect).

Hardware Requirement :
- M5AtomS3
  
Software Requirement :
This little parasite use m5stack-avatar to render face, donwload avatar librairie before compile.
- https://github.com/meganetaaan/m5stack-avatar

It pretty small so you can also check serial on USB to get information.
