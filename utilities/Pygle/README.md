# Pygle - Offline Wi-Fi Visualization Tool

**Pygle** is a Python script designed to visualize Wi-Fi data from wardriving CSV files, similar to WiGLE but in an offline environment. It allows you to map Wi-Fi networks on an interactive map using data like MAC addresses, SSIDs, RSSI, and geographic coordinates.

## Features

- Visualizes Wi-Fi networks on an interactive map using latitude and longitude.
- Displays additional information in pop-ups, including SSID, MAC address, authentication mode, RSSI, and more.
- Color-codes Wi-Fi markers based on signal strength (RSSI).
- Works entirely offline.

## Requirements

Before using Pygle, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)

You can install the required libraries with the following command:

pip install pandas folium chardet

## How to Use

Prepare your CSV file:

The CSV file should have data in a similar format to the one provided by WiGLE, containing information such as MAC address, SSID, RSSI, and GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude).
And named data.csv on same folder than the python script.

Execute the Python script in your terminal:

python pygle.py

View the output:

After running the script, an HTML file wifi_map.html will be generated in the same directory. You can open this file in any web browser to see the interactive map of Wi-Fi networks.

## Color

Color-Coding Based on RSSI

Wi-Fi markers are color-coded based on signal strength (RSSI):

- Green: Strong signal (RSSI ≥ -70 dBm)
- Orange: Moderate signal (-85 dBm ≤ RSSI < -70 dBm)
- Red: Weak signal (RSSI < -85 dBm)

You can modify these thresholds in the script by editing the get_color() function.

## Data Popups

Each Wi-Fi marker displays additional information such as:

SSID: The name of the network
MAC: The MAC address of the access point
Auth Mode: The type of encryption (e.g., WPA, WPA2)
RSSI: Signal strength in dBm
First Seen: Timestamp of when the network was first detected
Altitude: Altitude in meters
Accuracy: Accuracy of the GPS coordinates
