# WigleOpenFinder

## Description

This Python script uses the Nominatim API from OpenStreetMap to retrieve the coordinates of a given city and the Wigle API to search for open Wi-Fi networks in that geographical area. The SSIDs of the found networks are sorted, displayed in the console, and saved to a text file.

---

## Features

- Retrieve geographical coordinates of a city using the Nominatim API.
- Search for unsecured Wi-Fi networks within a 0.5-degree radius around the provided coordinates.
- Extract and sort SSIDs of open networks.
- Save the SSIDs to a text file.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `requests` library installed in your Python environment.
- A Wigle account with a valid API token.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Add your Wigle API token to the variable `api_token` in the script.
3. Ensure all required libraries are installed in your Python environment.
